### jnormcorre
This is a Jax-accelerated implementation of normcorre. 

## Installation
This software is currently only tested on linux/unix systems, though wider usage may be possible. 

Todo: Add Info on installation via conda/mamba

# Conda installation for developers (ubuntu)
First install mamba: 

```
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

Next, navigate to the root of thisÂ repository and run the following command: 
```
mamba env update -f environments/devel_ubuntu.yml
```

This will create a conda environment, "jnormcorre_devel", which will contain all dependencies. 

## Use Case
This implementation is for offline motion correction only. The code is currently set up to use multicore processing via python multiprocessing. GPU/TPU parallelization support will be provided soon.
